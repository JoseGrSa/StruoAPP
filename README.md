# StruoAPP
 
Struo is a motivational calendar app, this application is divided into three. 

1. Calendar : In the calendar section you can set goals to be achieved and organize them in a simple and easy way, you can also select the duration of the goals (Week,Month,Year), plus sub goals needed to achieve the main goal, (For example, learn the notes or learn a song if you want to learn piano), besides this in the calendar section you can organize your day to make sure you can put all your goals at your favorite times. 

2. Chat : In the chat section you can communicate with other users of the application to share tips or talks in general, if your tip is very useful for someone else can give you points with real money that you can use to unlock certain things in the application, you can also put questions or difficulties in this section. 

3. Blog : In the last section we share tips, news or general information that the Struo team finds, from youtube videos useful for various goals, to motivational messages and tips on how to take better care of yourself from Coronavirus. 

The goal is that people who don't find motivation to do things in quarantine can organize themselves in a simple and useful way, as well as be able to communicate with others and share their perspectives and experiences. The product is still not limited to Corona virus, although it is very useful for people in these times, it has the possibility to continue with relevance for a long time.

This APP was developed for the ONEMOTHHACK challenge and is still incomplete, though in the future I would love to keep working on it and finish it.
